If you're using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) you only need to install [Sentry's Vercel integration](/product/integrations/vercel/), then we'll automatically configure your environment for you.

Otherwise, you'll need to configure the following environment variables:

```shell
SENTRY_DSN="___PUBLIC_DSN___"

SENTRY_RELEASE="my-application@my-application-version"

# used for sourcemap publishing
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="api-auth-token"
SENTRY_PROJECT="___PROJECT_SLUG___"
SENTRY_ORG="___ORG_SLUG___"
```

<Note>

We don't currently expose any ability to pass additional configuration to the SDK's initialization call. If that's something you need, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-plugin-sentry).

</Note>

Lastly, enable generation and publishing of [source maps](sourcemaps/):

```javascript
const withSourceMaps = require("@zeit/next-source-maps")();
const withSentry = require("@next/sentry-source-maps")();

module.exports = withSentry(
  withSourceMaps({
    experimental: { plugins: true },
  })
);
```
