title: Migration

## From 1.x to 2.x

In `@sentry/react-native` version `2.x`, release health and native stack traces are now enabled by default.

This version uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/).
If you are using an on-premise installation it requires Sentry version
`>= v20.6.0` to work. If you are using sentry.io nothing will change and
no action is needed.

### iOS/MacOS

There are no immediate breaking changes for iOS/MacOS on the React Native side, just make sure you run `pod install` after the upgrade.

If you use the `sentry-cocoa` SDK directly, you should follow its [migration guide for 5.x to 6.x](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-5x-to-6x).

On iOS/MacOS, we now cache events in envelopes on the disk.
We decided not to take the effort to migrate these few cached events from 5.x to 6.x into
envelopes. Instead we remove them from the disk. This means you might lose a few cached
events of your users when upgrading.

### Android

If you are on React Native <0.60, you will need to update this line in your `MainApplication.java`:


Old:

```java
import io.sentry.RNSentryPackage;
```

New:
```java
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage;
```

Otherwise, there should be no other immediate breaking changes on the React Native side. If you use the `sentry-andoid` SDK directly, you should follow its [migration guide for 2.x to 3.x](/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-sentry-android-2x-to-sentry-android-3x).


## From 0.x to 1.x

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of `react-native-sentry` you should unlink the package to ensure the generated code is updated to the latest version:

```bash
react-native unlink react-native-sentry
```

After that remove `react-native-sentry` from your `package.json`:

```bash
npm uninstall react-native-sentry --save
# or
yarn remove react-native-sentry
```

From there you can follow the standard installation instructions for `@sentry/react-native`.
