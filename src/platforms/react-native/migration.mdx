## From 1.x to 2.x

In `@sentry/react-native` version `2.x`, release health and native stack traces are now enabled by default.

### iOS/MacOS

There are no immediate breaking changes for iOS/MacOS on the React Native side, just make sure you run `pod install` after the upgrade.

If you use the `sentry-cocoa` SDK directly, you should follow its [migration guide for 5.x to 6.x](/platforms/apple/migration/#migrating-from-5x-to-6x).

### Android

If you are on React Native <0.60, you will need to update this line in your `MainApplication.java`:


Old:

```java
import io.sentry.RNSentryPackage;
```

New:
```java
import io.sentry.react.RNSentryPackage;
```

Otherwise, there should be no other immediate breaking changes on the React Native side. If you use the `sentry-andoid` SDK directly, you should follow its [migration guide for 2.x to 3.x](/platforms/android/migration/#migrating-from-sentry-android-2x-to-sentry-android-3x).


## From 0.x to 1.x

If you are upgrading from an earlier version of `react-native-sentry` you should unlink the package to ensure the generated code is updated to the latest version:

```bash
react-native unlink react-native-sentry
```

After that remove `react-native-sentry` from your `package.json`:

```bash
npm uninstall react-native-sentry --save
# or
yarn remove react-native-sentry
```

From there you can follow the standard installation instructions for `@sentry/react-native`.
